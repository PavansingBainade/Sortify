# Sortify

## Overview
Sortify is an interactive sorting algorithm visualizer designed to help users understand various sorting algorithms through a dynamic, visual representation. It provides an intuitive and engaging way to see how different sorting techniques operate in real-time, making complex algorithms more accessible and easier to grasp.

## Features
- **Dynamic Visualizations:** Watch as sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort organize data in real-time.
- **Customizable Inputs:** Adjust the size and speed of the array to see how algorithms handle different scenarios.
- **Interactive Interface:** Easily switch between different sorting algorithms to compare their performance and behavior.
- **Detailed Information:** View the time and space complexity of each algorithm to understand their efficiency.

## How to Use
1. **Generate Array:** Use the slider to set the array size and click the "Generate New Array!" button to create a new set of data.
2. **Adjust Speed:** Use the speed slider to control how fast the sorting algorithms run.
3. **Run Algorithm:** Select an algorithm from the buttons to start the sorting process. Watch the visualization to see how the algorithm sorts the array.
